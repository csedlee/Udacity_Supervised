    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naïve Bayes(GNB) (https://iq.opengenus.org/gaussian-naive-bayes/) \n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Example: This is a database of various people based on their gender, age and estimated salary. The target is whether the person buys a SUV or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: In a supervised learning situation, Naive Bayes Classifiers are trained very efficiently. Naive Bayed classifiers need a small training data to estimate the parameters needed for classification. Naive Bayes Classifiers have simple design and implementation and they can applied to many real life situations. When we assume TP(or one-hot encoding '1' is where income is greater than 50K('>50K'), \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: When applying this model application, there is one missing colume, which is whether or not each perosn(or each row) has truly made a donation in the past. So a confusion matrix couldn't be applied for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate for the problem: Even though there are some missing column of 'donated_before', this GNV algorithm will give a very efficient classification of high possible future-donors. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/) \n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Example: For instance, will a customer attrite or not, should we target customer X for digital campaigns, whether customer has a high potential or not, etc. These analysis are more insightful and directly linked to an implementation roadmap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects: 1. Ease to interpret output 2. Calculation time 3. Predictive Power \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: One major drawback in calculating distance measures directly from the training set is in the case where variables have different measurement scales or there is a mixture of numerical and categorical variables. For example, if one variable is based on annual income in dollars, and the other is based on age in years then income will have a much higher influence on the distance calculated. One solution is to standardize the training set as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate for the problem: KNN algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithm. Even with such simplicity, it can give highly competitive results. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (https://towardsdatascience.com/stochastic-gradient-descent-clearly-explained-53d239905d31) \n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Example: The only difference between vanilla gradient descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent is the addition of the next_training_batch  function. Instead of computing our gradient over the entire data  set, we instead sample our data, yielding a batch. So it can be applicable to most of regression problems like a regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Converges faster because it performs updates more frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Due to frequent updates the steps taken towards the minima are very noisy. This can often lead the gradient descent into other directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification algorithm, given we are trying to determine income above or below 50k it is suitable. Upon review I now think this may not have been an optimal choice for this dataset as the number of features could be too large for this model. However as it was my initial choice I have kept it the same and learned from this. Also from interest I tested different models in the initial model evaluation and saw that Logistic Regression still performed well relative to others, therefore in practice it could be an okay choice but in theory maybe not.

Firstly one of its strengths are that it identifies its own mistakes and attempts to correct them through several iterations. In terms of the metrics there is not much distinguishing the three models though the F-score is the highest in all cases including when 100% of the testing set is used, this should be the most telling metric of all. The training time is also much shorter than the other two, which could have larger impacts when using a larger dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model is not much quicker than the AdaBoost Classifier which doesn't justify the loss of performance on the F-score. I expect there to be some good correlations between some of the features such as age and the target feature income, therefore I do not expect the data to be overly noisy.

    "We put emphasis on those mistakes so the next model knows to not make the same mistakes. However this model will also have misclassified some coins, depending on how complex the problem is. We simply repeat this process. Once we have reached a point where we have tried enough models to split up the data we now need to combine them all. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by adding up all of the errors of the models, which comes from a ratio of correct to incorrectly classified coins. Now a model that has more incorrect than correct coins will have a negative weighting, this is not a bad thing as it still gives us information about classification but we simply have to do the opposite of what it tells us. So having summed up the weights of each model, where the sum of the errors is positive and negative shows the split of the data; \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "I believe hours per week is the most telling of income overall as there would be a strong correlation between these two numbers, since money earned would be a direct result of hours worked. The remaining four features follow a similar theme of a higher education level and higher age would likely put someone in an occupation higher up a hierarchy therefore they would have a larger income. Though this would depend also on whether they work in the private sector, for the government or for themselves. Therefore the relevance becomes more complicated, but I still believe this factor to be of importance. I chose education number as it has an education level equivalent but is an integer therefore the model can better use it for prediction."

    "In selecting my 5 most important factors I was correct in selecting three of them; age, hours per week and education number though I did not correctly assume the order of importance. I did rank age as being of high importance though relative to hours per week I did not give it enough importance. The ranking of hours per week is surprising to me, though I guess it is telling of the type of job a person may have where their hourly wage could be drastically different. I was also very wrong in not selecting capital-loss or capital-gain, this is mostly down to not fully understanding their relevance. Also from looking at a small sample of the data above there was no clear pattern due to there being so many 0s in these columns."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
